\f0\fs24 \cf0 Experiment: Simulating Photon Passage Through Matter\
\
Description: \
\
In this experiment, we will use GEANT4 to simulate the passage of photons through matter. In the simulations a series of photons will be sent through different widths of materials (such as glass or water) and the number of photons which manage to pass through the material will be recorded.\
\
We will then compare the results of this simulation to a real experiment in which we will recreate the same scenario with a laser and a photodetector, noting the change in intensity of light when different materials are placed between the two. \
